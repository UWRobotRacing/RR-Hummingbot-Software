Supervisor
=========

The Supervisor node is an architectural module designed to manage high level decisions and provide services for other nodes to utilize. One of the core features of this node is to help a [twist multiplexer](https://github.com/ros-teleop/twist_mux prioritize which twist messages get published. The twist multiplexer is a 3rd party node that takes various twist message inputs, and based on the priority of the messages and any locks, will pick one to output on a ROS topic that the vehicle controller subscribes to. Currently, there is two sources of twist messages: path planner and the supervisor node itself. The supervisor node command topic is for simply sending null vectors to stop the robot. Additionally, the supervisor node publishes a Boolean to a topic that the twist multiplexer looks for to set priority locks on the incoming twist messages. This topic is used to lock out the path planner's messages, which is used to bring the robot to a complete stop. The twist message priority is as follows:  supervisor, path planner.
