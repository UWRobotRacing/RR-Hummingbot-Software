### Description:
This repository contains the current competition code (2018). This code will be used for the IARRC 2018. This code currently handles LIDAR mapping, trajectory rollout, PID speed control, lane detection and traffic light detection.

A list of what we're currently working on is in the issues section of this repo.

### Competition Rules:
Please review the competition rules before pushing any code :)

### Coding Standards:
For C++ code and Python Scripts we follow the Google coding standards linked below
* https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html
* https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html

Please fill out this header above all functions (Doxygen style)
``` cpp
/** @brief Writes the current position of the cursor
 *         into the arguments row and col.
 *  @param row The address to which the current cursor
 *         row will be written.
 *  @param col The address to which the current cursor
 *         column will be written.
 *  @return Void.
 */
void GetCursor(int* row, int* col);
```
Please fill this header out above every source code file(including launch files and xml files)
```
/** @file console.h
 *  @brief Function prototypes for the console driver.

In order to generate documentation, go to the base directory of this repo and run:
``` bash
doxygen doxygen_config
```
It is setup to document all \*.c, \*.cpp, \*.h, and \*.hpp files. It will generate html output under doxygen\_output/html. To view this, reference the index.html file in that directory in a browser of your choice. Feel free to change the doxygen\_config file in order to generate different types of documentation or cover more file types.

### Moving forward:
This code base should be integrated with the overall UWRobotics code such that modularity can be achieved?
