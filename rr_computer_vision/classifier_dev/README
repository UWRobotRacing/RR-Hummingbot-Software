Welcome to the Mapillary Vistas Dataset (Research edition, v1.1)!
The public set comprises 20,000 images, out of which 18,000 shall be used for training and the remaining 2,000 for validation. The official test set now contains 5,000 RGB images, see changelog below. We provide pixel-wise labels based on polygon annotations for 66 object classes, where 37 are annotated in an instance-specific manner (i.e. individual instances are labeled separately). The folder structures contain raw RGB images ({training,validation}/images), class-specific labels for semantic segmentation (8-bit with color-palette) ({training,validation}/labels), instance-specific annotations (16-bit) ({training,validation}/instances) and panoptic annotations (24-bit RGB images, {training,validation}/panoptic). Please run 'python demo.py' from the extracted folder to get an idea about how to access label information and for mappings between label IDs and category names.
